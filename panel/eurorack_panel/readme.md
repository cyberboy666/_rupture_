# _rupture_ eurorack_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 8mm standoffs
- this circuit is powered by 5v on 2.1_barrel_jack - a [vertical jack](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/dc-power-jack-2-1mm-round-type-panel-mount-1.html) soldered to bottom of pcb will allow powering from within eurorack case
- the small slide switches are possible but a bit more difficult to reach with a front panel on
- this panel is 8HP
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - consider replacing these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel
