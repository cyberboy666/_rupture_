# _rupture_ default_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 8mm standoffs
- 25mm screws will fit front_panel, pcb and back_plate
- the small slide switches are possible but a bit more difficult to reach with a front panel on
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - consider replacing these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel
